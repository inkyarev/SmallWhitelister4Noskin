# Professional skin whitelisting software by Revâ„¢

## Whatawhy
Automatic whitelisting of skins for Noskin mod (by Moga). Basically his mod turns skins off and my soft can turn them back on automatically(because frequent updates), though you can always do it manually.

Made this for myself then sorta remade for the general public for funzies.

## Setup and use
You put characters and skin ids in the config(template included), then run the program. You can change the skins and it should enable/disable them flawlessly.

## Other info
Of course you need [Noskin](https://runeforge.dev/mods/278e13db-0ecd-46ef-8282-f0f8b07fc08b) by [Moga](https://runeforge.dev/users/Moga).
