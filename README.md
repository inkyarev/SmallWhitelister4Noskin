# Professional skin whitelisting software by Revâ„¢

## Whatawhy
Automatic whitelisting of skins for [Noskin mod](https://runeforge.dev/mods/278e13db-0ecd-46ef-8282-f0f8b07fc08b) (by [Moga](https://runeforge.dev/users/Moga)). Basically his mod turns skins off and my soft can turn them back on automatically(because frequent updates), though you can always do it manually.

Made this for myself then sorta remade for the general public for funzies.

## Setup and use
Drop Noskin into cslol. You then put characters and skin ids in the config(template included) and run the program. You can change the skins and it should enable/disable them flawlessly.

## Building from source
Install .NET framework 4.8, then your IDE should auto restore nuget pkg, if it doesnt run `restore nuget`.

## Attributon
Includes wad-extract.exe from [cslol manager tools](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/cslol-manager)

## Other info
Of course you need [Noskin](https://runeforge.dev/mods/278e13db-0ecd-46ef-8282-f0f8b07fc08b) by [Moga](https://runeforge.dev/users/Moga).
